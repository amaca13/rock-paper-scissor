The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors
In this project
Users should be able to play a five-round game of the grade-school classic "rock paper scissors" against the computer from the browser console.

 My Process

This was my first time building a project in Javascript; it allowed me to test my knowledge of the fundamentals I've learned so far through The Odin Project and external resources.

In building my rock, paper, scissors game, I did the following:

- Prompted the user for input
- Declared variables
- Wrote if..else conditional statements
- Used for loops and while loops
- Defined and invoked functions
- Passed a function as an argument in another function
